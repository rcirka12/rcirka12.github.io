There are many way to use Option in Scala. Per scala docs, the idiomatic way to use Option is to treat it as a collection that can have either a length of one of zero.

Let's says we have a basic class, Author
### Simple Option checking

```scala
case class Author(name:Option[String])
val author:Author = ...
```

The traditional way is to check to see if the name is defined. This way can be prone to error is you forget to add the "get" method

```scala
val authorName:String = if (author.name.isDefined) author.name.get else "empty"[/scala]
```

A simplier way to check for Option is GetOrElse

```scala
val authorName:String = author.name.getOrElse("blank")
```

In Scala 2.10, the fold method was introduced for Option. You could also use the following syntax:

```scala
val authorName:String = author.name.fold("empty")
```

It saves a little bit of typing, but not much difference, it might confuse those that are not familiar with it.

You could also use pattern matching on Option, which is generally discouraged, since it is rather verbose.

```scala
val authorName:String =
  author.name match {
    case Some(name) => name
    case _ => "empty"
  }
```

### Nested Options
Let's say our author variable is now an option:

```scala
val author:Option[Author] = ...
```

Using the isDefined method is getting rather verbose and error prone here.

```scala
val authorName:String = if (author.isDefined && author.get.name.isDefined) author.name.get else "empty"
```

You could use getOrElse here, but you would still need to check is the the author is defined. Still rather clunky.

```scala
val authorName:String = if (author.isDefined) author.get.name.get else "empty"
```

The most idiomatic way is to use nested options is map. The following will return the name if both author and author.name are present

```scala
val authorName:Option[String] = author.map(_.name)[/scala]
```

Or:

```scala
val authorName:String = author.map(_.name).getOrElse("name is empty")
```

### Multiple Nested Options
Let's up the ante here.

```scala
case class Author(name:Option[Name])
case class Name(firstName:Option[String], lastName:Option[String])
val author:Option[Author] = ...
```

In this scenario, author, author.name, and author.firstName could be None. FlatMap to the rescue.

```scala
val authorName = author.flatMap(_.name).flatMap(_.firstName)
```

Or

```scala
val authorName = author.flatMap(_.name).flatMap(_.firstName).getOrElse("first name is empty")
```

flatMap reduces the nested options, allowing use to retrieve what we need.

Another way is to use a for-comprehension. It is a little more verbose, but allows us to make the code a little cleaner and easy to maintain. It is best used when dealing with multiple levels of Options.

```scala
val authorName:Option[String] = for {
author <- author
name <- author.name
firstName <- name.firstName
} yield firstName
```

or

```scala
val authorName:String = (for {
author <- author
name <- author.name
firstName <- name.firstName
} yield firstName).getOrElse("First name is empty")
```
